PyPSA-GB: An open source model of the GB power system for future energy scenarios
=================================================================================

Energy system models with high spatial and temporal resolution are required to analyse systems reliant on variable renewable generation. This paper presents PyPSA-GB which is an open dataset and power dispatch model of the GB transmission network using country-specific data over historical years and for future energy scenarios. Two aspects of the GB electricity market can be readily modelled: (i) the wholesale electricity market, by solving a single bus unit commitment optimisation problem to dispatch generators and storage, and (ii) the balancing mechanism, by solving a network constrained linear optimal power flow. The model is showcased through an analysis of network expansion for National Gridâ€™s net zero future energy scenarios.
